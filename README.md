# Hi, I'm Sanjan 👋🏽 🤓 💻

- I'm currently a Site Reliability Engineer @ Salesforce ☁️
- And I'm passionate 😍 about automating monitoring systems.
- In my coding I mostly use Python 🐍 (just because I don't have to worry about missed semi-colons!)
- And for some reason I have 3 stackoverflow accounts 😬
